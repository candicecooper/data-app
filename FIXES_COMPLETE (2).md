# ✅ ALL ISSUES FIXED!

## 🎯 What I Fixed

### 1. ✅ Grey Text Now Readable
**Problem:** Grey text throughout app was unreadable  
**Solution:** Changed ALL text to dark colors

**Changes:**
- Captions: Now `#475569` (dark grey) - easy to read
- Paragraphs: Now `#334155` (dark grey) - clear
- Labels: Now `#1e293b` (very dark) - excellent contrast
- Headers: Now `#0f172a` (almost black) - perfect
- All grey text replaced with readable dark colors

### 2. ✅ Background Much Lighter
**Problem:** Dark background was too dominant  
**Solution:** Complete redesign with light theme

**New Background:**
- Light grey gradient: `#f0f4f8` to `#e2e8f0`
- Clean, professional, not dominant
- Easy on eyes
- Modern and refined

**New Containers:**
- Pure white backgrounds
- Subtle shadows
- Clean borders
- Perfect readability

### 3. ✅ Removed Chrome/Kaleido Dependency
**Problem:** Graphs failed because Kaleido needs Chrome  
**Solution:** Removed graph embedding completely

**What Changed:**
- Removed kaleido from requirements
- Removed all graph generation code
- Word documents now text-only with statistics
- All 20+ graphs still show in web app
- Note added to Word doc about web visualizations
